<ol>

 <li>implement the strassen matrix mult function to multiply two 2<em><sup>n</sup></em>× 2<em><sup>n </sup></em>matrices by using the Strassen’s algorithm;</li>

 <li>generalize strassen matrix mult to deal with any kind of matrix pair that can be multiplied (possibly also non-square matrices) and prove that the asymptotic complexity does not change;</li>

 <li>improve the implementation of the function by reducing the number of auxiliary matrices and test the effects on the execution time;</li>

 <li>answer to the following question: how much is the minimum auxiliary space required to evaluate the Strassen’s algorithm? Motivate the answer.</li>
